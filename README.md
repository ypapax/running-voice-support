## FAQ

### Why do I need both Location and Motion permissions?
**Location** permission allows GPS tracking for accurate distance. **Motion & Fitness** permission enables step counting as a backup when GPS signal is weak. This dual approach ensures your run is always tracked reliably.

### Can I use the app without GPS?
Yes! The app uses step counting to track your distance when GPS is unavailable or unreliable.

### Does the app work with the screen locked?
Yes, the app continues tracking in the background. Lock your phone to save battery during your run.

### How do voice announcements work with music?
Voice announcements automatically lower your music volume, deliver the update, then restore your music volume. You don't need to pause anything.

### Can I turn off voice announcements?
Yes, go to **Settings** and toggle "Progress Announcements" off. You can still track your run without audio updates.

### Can I change units during a run?
No, distance units cannot be changed during an active run to maintain data consistency. Stop your run first, then change the unit in Settings.

### Where is my data stored?
All your run data is stored locally on your device. No account required, no cloud syncing, complete privacy.
