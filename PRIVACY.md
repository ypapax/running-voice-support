# Privacy Policy for Running Voice

**Last Updated: November 9, 2025**

## Overview

Running Voice ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data from the App.**

The App operates entirely on your device with no backend servers, no user accounts, and no data transmission to external parties.

## Information Storage

All data generated by the App is stored locally on your iPhone:

- **Run History**: Distance, duration, pace, speed, and step count from your runs
- **Settings**: Your preferences for distance units and time format
- **Location Data**: GPS coordinates used only during active runs for distance calculation

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to us or any third parties
- Is accessible only by you
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the App

## Permissions

The App requests the following permissions to function:

### Location Services
- **Purpose**: Calculate distance and route during runs using GPS
- **Usage**: Only accessed when you start a run
- **Data**: GPS coordinates are processed on-device and never transmitted
- **Storage**: Location data is not permanently stored; only distance calculations are saved

### Motion & Fitness
- **Purpose**: Count steps and calculate distance when GPS is unavailable
- **Usage**: Only accessed during active runs
- **Data**: Step counts are processed on-device and never transmitted
- **Storage**: Only step counts and calculated distances are saved locally

## Third-Party Services

The App does not use:
- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Third-party SDKs
- Cloud storage services
- Social media integrations
- Crash reporting tools

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to anyone because we do not collect it in the first place.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device:
- Your data is protected by your iPhone's security features
- No transmission means no risk of interception
- No servers means no risk of data breaches

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: View your run history anytime in the App
- **Delete**: Delete individual runs or all data by uninstalling the App
- **Export**: Your data is stored in your device's local database

## iCloud Backup

If you have iCloud Backup enabled on your iPhone, your App data may be included in your iCloud backup. This is controlled by iOS system settings, not by the App. Data in iCloud backups is encrypted and protected by your Apple ID.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
